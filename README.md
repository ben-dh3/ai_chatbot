* Crypto website created as an example for freelancing clients on Fiverr. This single page React application with colourful artwork follows the conventions of “Meme Coin” websites in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

* Website optimised for accessibility and SEO using Lighthouse. I created the graphics in Piskel before designing the layout of each section in Figma. 

* I wrote the smart contract for this crypto token in Solidity and deployed it to Base layer 2 on Ethereum. The smart contract is verified and available on Base Etherscan (a block explorer for Base chain).



### Built With

* React
* Javascript
* Solidity
* Piskel
* Tailwind
* Figma
