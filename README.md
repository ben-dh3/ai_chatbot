# HomerBot

Chat with Homer to your heart's content. This is an AI chat bot using OpenAI's API. The AI model has been fine tuned with dialogue to respond like Homer Simpson.

The UI has been designed with references to Simpsons episodes, and pixel animations created in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

In the future I intend to improve the UI by making it fully responsive and available to use on mobile.
